for refactoring:
- put the entire workflow into the Drift object for simplicity so we're not importing 16,000 different modules
- Drift takes the car_dict as input
- calls url generator
- scrapes
- processes data
- writes data

add modules to scrape edmunds.com

add a "fudge factor" to the exponential decay on mileage to account for model years - start with a linear function

car edge - useful life of 12 years - try implmenting this to compare price paid against useful life left
google says cars are designed to last 200k miles ish, so also try that.

add all major city codes in USA

to make main.py callable from terminal, redo the environment with a TOML file

fix unit test coverage lol

mongodb integration? not really sure what this would be good for tho tbh
