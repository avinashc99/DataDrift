+ refactored. left the scrapers as functions in their folders since OOP-ifying them was too much effort.

- add modules to scrape edmunds.com

- add the option to perform the analysis for each individual trim of car

- add a "fudge factor" to the exponential decay on mileage to account for model years - start with a linear function

- compare depreciation to useful life
car edge - useful life of 12 years - try implmenting this to compare price paid against useful life left
google says cars are designed to last 200k miles ish, so also try that.

- add all major city codes in USA

- switch from conda to poetry?
to make main.py callable from terminal, redo the environment with a TOML file

- fix unit test coverage lol

- mongodb integration? not really sure what this would be good for tho tbh
